                <p><b>Hello!</b><br>
                    This website was created as part of my Web Design Decal final project. I am currently a sophomore, 
                    majoring in Economics and additionally also hope to obtain my certification in Design Innovation.  <br><br>

                    I was born in Flushing, New York and grew up in Albertson. It’s about 20 minutes away from New York City. 
                    I moved to the Bay Area a year and a half ago for school, and so far, it’s been a fantastic experience. 
                    On campus, I'm involved with multiple organizations and like to spend my time dancing within The Berkeley Dance Community. 
                    After graduating, I intend to move back to NYC.  <br><br>

                    I am currently looking for internships for this upcoming summer as well as Fall 2019, so feel free to shoot 
                    me a message!
                     </p>
