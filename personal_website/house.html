                    • Partner with student-run organizations to make them aware of opportunities such as mentorship through The House
                    Residency or funding through The House Ventures Fund <br>

                <p id = "orgs">I went through Berkeley's central student organization list and found the contact information of potential orgs 
                    to onboard. From there, I reached out to these organizations, and if there was mutual interest on both side, I created partnership 
                    agreements for the upcoming Fall Semester. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to disclose much more than this but take a look at the
